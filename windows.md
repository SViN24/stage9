# The Better Windows

So you have to use Windows ,either because of hardware compadibilites with Linux, Work or just wanting to play games.

But you dont want any of the mobile apps and less of the privacy issues.
OR you do not want any frequent updates breaking your computer

**DO NOTE:** may have issues running software with this method.

What you need my friend is Windows 10 LTSC and a lot of patience.

Windows 10 LTSC is a special version of windows that is meant for enterprise wanting stable systems that to do not update often. As of 2020 Windows 10 LTSC is based on 1809. A clean ISO (which I do not provide) is required

The other thing you need is an existing windows installation(VM is also fine). And also a program called Optimize-Offline

To use Optimize offline you need to go to the releases page, Get the source code and then run the file Start-Optimize.ps1 using powershell.

The rest is fairly straightforward, you remove applications and features that you will *not* use on Windows such as the mobile apps and then choose a compression level.
Compression can take a while and you may want to choose None since you may want to test the iso for breakages.
